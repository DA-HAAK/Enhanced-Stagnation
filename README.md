Survive as long as you can.

Gameplay:

The player Stan ( a variant of 'v', '<', '>', or '^' ) can go in any 
direction for one space per turn, but the same goes for the Hance, 
who are innumerable and have decided to make Stann their next meal.
They are the enhanced, for they can steadily create more of their
ilk, while stand-still Stann is stuck in the stagnation of being 
unable to heal or increase in number. But he still stands steadfast
and fights to stay alive, his point being an impenetrable sheild,
impervious to the damage that the Hance try to burden him with.

See how long you can make Stann survive this onslaught.
